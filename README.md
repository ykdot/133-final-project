## College Digital Assistant

College Digitial Assistant is a digital assistant web app where it is designed to help students track their daily, weekly and monthly tasks and stay organized during their academic year. The assistant aids in managing class assignments, extracurricular commitments, note-taking, and organizing events.

### Core Features
1. Responsive Design: This project uses Next JS to create HTML and CSS that makes the app look and function well on different screen size. 
2. User interaction: This project supports user inputs where users can add/edit/delete tasks on the tasklist page. For each task, there is a task name, date and time, task priority, and the label of the task. 
3. Data persistence: We used the local storage on the browser to maintain data with any actions like refreshing the page, and used React context to update the UI and local storage whenever tasks are added, deleted, or edited.  
4. API: We used the ZenQuotes.io API to fetch quote information to display in the task-list page.
